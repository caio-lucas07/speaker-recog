# Speaker Recognition 
Jupyter notebook for a task of speaker recognition using MFCC coefficients for voice representation and SVM for the speaker classification.

MFCC makes use of the MEL scale to divide the frequency band into sub-bands, and then extract the cepstral coefficients using the discrete cosine transform (DCT).
